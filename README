This package contains a simple set of scripts to aid in testing
Open vSwitch. In particular, to compare to standard Linux 
bridging.

Requirements
------------

1. A working Open vSwitch Installation. 

2. Currently there is only support for KVM, but other platforms,
such as Xen should be able to be supported. Patches welcome :)

Instructions for working with KVM and Open vSwitch have been 
committed. 
See: INSTALL.KVM (in a release > 1.0.0) or
http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=openvswitch;a=blob_plain;f=INSTALL.KVM;hb=6cdd6a87ac43b4d7cc4cfe99f2ae4435afd38951

3. Primary testing has been done on Ubuntu 10.04. 

Dependencies include:

 - nbd-client

Install
-------

./install.sh


Usage
-----

At minimum you'll need a base guest image in qcow2 format and a 
file named mac_addr in /etc/ovs-testing/<guest name>/ that 
contains a valid MAC address (e.g 00:11:22:BB:AA:DD)

Beyond that, to run benchmarks you need to have them available.

To generate graphs, you'll need gnuplot.

Example usage:

ovst-setup-network ovs eth0 br0 10.0.0.100
ovst-start_guest ovs /path/to/base/image.qcow2 guest1
ovst-start_guest ovs /path/to/base/image.qcow2 guest2
ovst-run-net-test netpipe guest1 guest2 guest1-guest2-netpipe.out
ovst-generate-graph guest1-guest2-netpipe.out
